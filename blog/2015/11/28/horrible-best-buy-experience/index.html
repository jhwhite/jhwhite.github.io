<div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s what happened:</p>

<p>On Oct 15th I ordered a dishwasher from the store in Charlottesville VA. I was told it would be delivered on Oct 26. It was delivered but was defective and didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>I go back to the store and did an exchange. I was told the new dishwasher would be delivered on Nov 2. The install team called me the night before and scheduled a time. But on the delivery day no one showed or called. I called the delivery team and they said someone from the store was suppose to call me to tell me the store didn&rsquo;t actually have the dishwasher.</p>

<p>I went back to the store wanting to do a return but one of the managers upgraded me to the next best model free of charge and showed me they had 25 dishwashers in stock at a warehouse and promised me I would have it in a week.</p>

<p>So we scheduled a delivery for Nov 9. The night before the install, the team called me and scheduled a time. The install team called me the next morning and told me the store once again didn&rsquo;t have the dishwasher.</p>

<p>I go to the store and one of the low level managers immediately does a refund and has the install team come get the defective dishwasher. He did this as I walked in the door, I didn&rsquo;t have to say anything, I hadn&rsquo;t talked to him before so I&rsquo;m guessing the previous manager I talked to told him the story, but then for whatever reason the previous manager wouldn&rsquo;t come talk to me.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving day I was reviewing my checking account for the month of November and see Best Buy never refunded my money from the dishwasher return.</p>

<p>I go to the store, I know they&rsquo;re going to be busy, but I get there before the store opens so they&rsquo;re not dealing with the rush of customers in the store. I talk to an employee outside, describe to him who did the return and he goes to get that guy. The employee comes back alone because the manager I last talked to is now refusing to talk to me.</p>

<p>They say they&rsquo;re too busy, that they can&rsquo;t talk to me. I understand that. But I mean, they owe me $500 because of a mistake they made. I asked for the store manager or district manager&rsquo;s name and the employee refused to give those to me. He wasn&rsquo;t wearing a name tag and he wouldn&rsquo;t give me his name.</p>

<p>Then he started telling me that this is my fault for not realizing they didn&rsquo;t do the refund sooner and if I had waited this long I could wait until next week. And that I must not need the money if I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before. He said if this was really important I would have noticed sooner and since I didn&rsquo;t see they never refunded the money it must not really be that important. Some of the stuff he told me didn&rsquo;t make sense. He told me banks were closed so they couldn&rsquo;t do the refund, but banks are closed on Saturday and Sunday every week and Best Buy processes refunds on those days all the time.</p>

<p>How that employee talked to me is what really upsets me, frustrates me, and makes me angry. Best Buy has messed up this transaction from the very beginning yet this employee makes it sound like THEM not refunding the money is trivial and perhaps even my fault. I was livid. I didn&rsquo;t expect to get much traction on Thanksgiving but I thought I would try, but for them to turn around and make this my fault is just ridiculous.</p>
